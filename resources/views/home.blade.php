<p>Your Application will now be reviewed by the Pre Reg Team, if you could please read the below information before closing this window.</p>

<h5 class="primary py-3">1. How will I know my application has been successfully processed?</h5>

<p>We will write to you to confirm if your application has been accepted - this may take several weeks after the deadline for receipt of applications. The letter will provide you with your pre-registration training number and confirm your anticipated start date. Your tutor will also receive a confirmation letter</p>


<h5 class="primary py-3">2. What if my Fitness to Practise circumstances change during the application process or my training year?</h5>

<p>You must notify us if anything occurs that would change the fitness to practise declaration that you made part of the application. This must be done within 7 days. A ‘Self Declaration Form’ must be completed.</p>


<h5 class="primary py-3">3. What if my tutor/site/dates have changed after I have submitted my application?</h5>

<p>If your start date changes prior to commencing training, please ask your employer to email us at pre-registration@psni.org.uk with the details of the change – NB the Pharmaceutical Society will only take instruction from the employer.</p>

<p>If your tutor or training site changes you must follow the notification procedure outlined in the Pre-registration Training Manual (Page 13).</p>

<p>Please note - in the event that you do not notify us of changes to training arrangements, all training subsequent to the un-notified change, will not be recognised.</p>


<h5 class="primary py-3">4. What is the earliest date that I can join the register after completing training in 2021?</h5>

<p>Results from the summer assessment will be released on 22 July 2021. Results for the autumn assessment will be released on 28 October 2021.</p>
